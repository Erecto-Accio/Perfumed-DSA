###  Tail Recursion
> Tail recursion is defined as a recursive function in which the recursive call is the last statement that is executed by the function

> The function doesnâ€™t have to process or perform any operation at  the time of calling and all operations are done at returning time.
 
> **Tail Recursion can be converted into loop easily**

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void fun(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        cout << n << endl;
    }
    fun(n - 1); // call of the tail recursion
}

int main() {
    int x = 3;
    fun(x);
}
// TIME : O(n)
// SPACE : O(n)
